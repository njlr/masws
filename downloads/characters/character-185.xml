Bison is a powerful villain in the Street Fighter Universe. He leads the evil organization Shadaloo and fights his opponents with 'Psycho Power'.]]></deck><description><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2><p>M. Bison, known as Vega in Japan, is one of the primary bosses of the <a data-ref-id="3025-331" href="/street-fighter/3025-331/" slug="street-fighter">Street Fighter</a> fighting game series.</p><p>Due to the boxer character in <a data-ref-id="3030-243" href="/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/" slug="street-fighter-ii">Street Fighter II</a> being a parody of <a data-ref-id="3040-89763" href="/mike-tyson/3040-89763/" slug="mike-tyson">Mike Tyson</a>, <a data-ref-id="3010-367" href="/capcom/3010-367/" slug="capcom">Capcom</a> decided to avoid possible lawsuits by rotating the names of three of the characters for the American version: M. Bison the boxer became <a data-ref-id="3005-61" href="/balrog/3005-61/" slug="balrog">Balrog</a>, Balrog the Spanish warrior became <a data-ref-id="3005-30" href="/vega/3005-30/" slug="vega">Vega</a>, and Vega the evil dictator became M. Bison. Capcom has also stated that the name was changed because Vega wasn't a menacing enough name for the game's last boss. Completing the parody, the boxer's first name is Mike, but no explanation has ever been given as to what the M. in the dictator's name could stand for. Perhaps it's Major or "Monsieur".</p><p>Bison's general attire consists of a red military uniform with large silver shoulder plates, wrist bands, shin guards, and a cape; on his cap is the skull insignia of his crime syndicate known as <a data-ref-id="3015-2812" href="/shadaloo/3015-2812/" slug="shadaloo">Shadaloo</a> (sometimes referred to as Shadowlaw or Shadowloo). Bison's eyes lack both pupils and irises (exception in "Street Fighter II"), leaving them a ghastly white color. He sports a dark colored <a data-ref-id="3055-1726" href="/cape/3055-1726/" slug="cape">cape</a> in the <a data-ref-id="3025-960" href="/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/" slug="street-fighter-alpha">Alpha</a> series, in which he appears with his original body. In Street Fighter II and the <a data-ref-id="3025-1659" href="/snk-vs-capcom/3025-1659/" slug="snk-vs-capcom">Capcom vs SNK</a> series, he appears with a much slimmer body and removes his cape before battle.</p><h2>History</h2><p>His first appearance, chronologically speaking, was in <a data-ref-id="3030-11802" href="/street-fighter-alpha-warriors-dreams/3030-11802/" slug="street-fighter-alpha-warriors-dreams">Street Fighter Alpha</a>, as the head of an elusive criminal and military organization known as <a data-ref-id="3015-2812" href="/shadaloo/3015-2812/" slug="shadaloo">Shadaloo</a>. Along with his aspirations for world conquest, M. Bison had been working on perfecting a lethal and deadly energy that would exponentially increase his fighting ability, an inherently evil energy he refers to as "Psycho Power". During the events of Street Fighter Alpha, Shadaloo came to the attention of Interpol, which sent <a data-ref-id="3005-267" href="/chun-li/3005-267/" slug="chun-li">Chun-Li</a> (an operative with a personal vendetta against the crime lord, who had killed her father) to thwart Bison's plans. Chun-Li and M. Bison eventually confronted each other and battled. M. Bison defeated Chun-Li and then escaped on his <a data-ref-id="3055-361" href="/helicopter/3055-361/" slug="helicopter">helicopter</a> while mocking her and promising to kill her in the same manner he killed her father if she confronts him again. During the events of Alpha or <a data-ref-id="3030-19134" href="/street-fighter-alpha-2/3030-19134/" slug="street-fighter-alpha-2">Alpha 2</a>, M. Bison also came into conflict with <a data-ref-id="3005-3143" href="/rose/3005-3143/" slug="rose">Rose</a>, a mysterious woman who wielded Soul Power, the opposite of Bison's Psycho Power. This fact and the fact that her quest was to stop any and all of M. Bison's evil plans indicate the intricate connection between the two, and would later be revealed in <a data-ref-id="3030-1328" href="/street-fighter-alpha-3/3030-1328/" slug="street-fighter-alpha-3">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a>.</p><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1674282-sfa3_m_bison1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1674282" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121177/1674282-sfa3_m_bison1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1674282"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/121177/1674282-sfa3_m_bison1.jpg"></a><figcaption>M. Bison as he appearers in Street Fighter Alpha 3</figcaption></figure><p>By the time of Street Fighter Alpha 3, the Psycho Power began exceeding the limits of his body. Having predicted this event, M. Bison had his scientists engineer a body that he could transfer his essence to, but that body <a data-ref-id="3005-331" href="/cammy/3005-331/" slug="cammy">Cammy</a> escaped from Shadaloo's conditioning. M. Bison then turned his sights to <a data-ref-id="3005-103" href="/ryu/3005-103/" slug="ryu">Ryu</a>, one of the most powerful fighters in the world, and the personal nemesis of Bison's right-hand man <a data-ref-id="3005-102" href="/sagat/3005-102/" slug="sagat">Sagat</a>. Bison defeated and captured Ryu and subjected him to intense psychological conditioning; when Sagat objected, M. Bison turned Ryu on him, telling him he could finally have his rematch. While Sagat battled Ryu, Ryu's friends <a data-ref-id="3005-212" href="/ken-masters/3005-212/" slug="ken-masters">Ken</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-437" href="/sakura-kasugano/3005-437/" slug="sakura-kasugano">Sakura</a> fought M. Bison. With Sagat's urging, Ryu came to his senses and forced M. Bison to retreat to the Psycho Drive, which restored his power.</p><p>In Street Fighter Alpha 3, USAF officers <a data-ref-id="3005-3409" href="/charlie/3005-3409/" slug="charlie">Charlie</a> and <a data-ref-id="3005-266" href="/guile/3005-266/" slug="guile">Guile</a> are on a mission to stop the dictator from using his new creation, a satellite (featured in Street Fighter Alpha 3), which can enhance his Psycho Power abilities. Guile and Charlie are joined by Chun-Li, and the three of them battle M. Bison. In order to take down Shadaloo's leader, Charlie keeps fighting him while the base is set to explode, and eventually sacrifices his own life. M. Bison's soul, however, ended up surviving the explosion and took control of Rose. It is revealed that, while trying to master Psycho Power, Bison had to expel all the humanity and good in his soul to accommodate and supplant the intense energy the power gives him, and that Rose is actually the formation of all of M. Bison's good energy. He stayed inside of Rose's body until his Shadaloo scientists could forge a new body for him, the body seen in Street Fighter II. This body, however, was much weaker, since, having inhabited his "good side"'s soul for a period of time, he retained both his good and evil energies as he transferred to his new body, thus making his Psycho Power considerably less effective.</p><p>M. Bison held the second Street Fighter tournament to get revenge against the people who had destroyed the Psycho Drive. His new body was much weaker than the previous, but he was still very powerful. In the end, he was destroyed by <a data-ref-id="3005-433" href="/akuma/3005-433/" slug="akuma">Akuma</a>, who killed him with the Shun Goku Satsu and sent his soul to hell to be destroyed. During the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-20456" href="/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/" slug="street-fighter-iv">Street Fighter IV</a> Bison has a new body capable of handling his Psycho Power created by a group of S.I.N. scientists. Bison was not heard of in <a data-ref-id="3030-21948" href="/street-fighter-iii-new-generation/3030-21948/" slug="street-fighter-iii-new-generation">Street Fighter III</a>, and Chun-Li's mid-boss dialogue with <a data-ref-id="3005-3113" href="/urien/3005-3113/" slug="urien">Urien</a> in <a data-ref-id="3030-1615" href="/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/" slug="street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a> suggests that Shadaloo was destroyed.</p><h2>Gameplay and Techniques</h2><p>M. Bison is a "charge character" in that, his special moves require that you hold in directions for a few seconds before pulling a move off. One of his special moves is the "Psycho Crusher" which sends him flying in the direction of his opponent with a damaging spin. The "Scissors Kick" allows him to do a forward flip which will knock the opponent away. With the "Head Stomp", Bison jumps into the air and homes into the opponent, bouncing off their heads in which he can follow up and smack them with his own hands.</p><p>In the Alpha series, he gained new moves such as the "Psycho Shot" which was his very own projectile and a couple abilities which allowed him to teleport and hover in the air.</p><p>His Super Attacks contain a more powerful version of the Psycho Crusher (In Alpha 3, it is his most powerful attack taking up the whole screen when used) and the Knee Press Nightmare, which is a more varied version of the Scissors Kick.</p><p>Shin M. Bison is an alternate version of M. Bison with more powerful abilities, fewer weaknesses, and often a different costume. Much like <a data-ref-id="3005-433" href="/akuma/3005-433/" slug="akuma">Shin Akuma</a>, this modified version of the character is meant to portray Bison when he chooses to unleash the true depths of his power. The only canon appearance of Shin M. Bison takes place in <a data-ref-id="3030-1328" href="/street-fighter-alpha-3/3030-1328/" slug="street-fighter-alpha-3">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a> (often referred to as Final M. Bison) but he has also appeared in both <a data-ref-id="3030-11370" href="/street-fighter-ex2-plus/3030-11370/" slug="street-fighter-ex2-plus">Street Fighter EX2 Plus</a> (referred to as Bison II), and <a data-ref-id="3030-10989" href="/street-fighter-ex3/3030-10989/" slug="street-fighter-ex3">Street Fighter EX3</a> as a secret, computer-only boss character.</p><p>When fighting in this more powerful form, Bison’s abilities differ from game to game. In Street Fighter Alpha 3, his fierce punch attacks send out a wave of energy and his psycho crusher super combo fills the entire screen with a devastating streak of blue flames. This improved psycho crusher is much faster and stronger than its normal counterpart, cannot be blocked in the air, and does severe damage even when blocked.</p><p>In Street Fighter EX 2 Plus and Street Fighter EX3, Shin M. Bison appears with pale, indigo-tinted skin and a white uniform. In both of these games, he has an infinite amount of SC energy, the ability to cancel most of his moves, and three greatly improved psycho cannon projectile attacks.</p><p>Shin M. Bison also tends to be far more aggressive than his normal counterpart in all the titles he appears in, and makes frequent use of his <a data-ref-id="3015-8" href="/teleportation/3015-8/" slug="teleportation">teleporting</a> ability.</p><h2><b>Alternate Costumes</b></h2><p>M.
