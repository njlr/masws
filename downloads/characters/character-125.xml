(sometimes referencing the series in taunts, such as "You fight like <a data-ref-id="3005-224" href="/johnny-cage/3005-224/" slug="johnny-cage">Johnny Cage!</a>")</p><h2>Story (canon)</h2><h3>Prior to the Tournaments</h3><p>Millions of years prior to the Mortal Kombat games, he fought the rogue elder god <a data-ref-id="3005-405" href="/shinnok/3005-405/" slug="shinnok">Shinnok</a> in a war that threatened to destroy Earthrealm. After being victorious, he banishes Shinnok to the <a data-ref-id="3035-615" href="/netherrealm/3035-615/" slug="netherrealm">Netherrealm</a> and secured Shinnok's amulet of power in a secret location guarded by the gods of wind, fire, earth, and water. However, in <a data-ref-id="3030-17295" href="/mortal-kombat-mythologies-sub-zero/3030-17295/" slug="mortal-kombat-mythologies-sub-zero">Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a>, the evil sorceror <a data-ref-id="3005-402" href="/quan-chi/3005-402/" slug="quan-chi">Quan Chi</a> (with the help of the older <a data-ref-id="3005-152" href="/noob-saibot/3005-152/" slug="noob-saibot">Sub-Zero</a>), stole the amulet and entered Netherrealm to bring Shinnok back. Unable to enter Netherrealm himself, Raiden instructs the older Sub-Zero to follow Quan Chi and retrieve the amulet. (which he accomplishes)</p><h3>The Earthrealm and Outworld Tournaments</h3><p>Raiden was then given a personal invitation to the <a data-ref-id="3030-15743" href="/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/" slug="mortal-kombat">Mortal Kombat</a> tournament by its host, the evil sorceror <a data-ref-id="3005-92" href="/shang-tsung/3005-92/" slug="shang-tsung">Shang Tsung</a>. (in which every tournament won by the massive <a data-ref-id="3005-275" href="/goro/3005-275/" slug="goro">Goro</a> results in weakening Earthrealm's barriers to the invading force of the emperor of <a data-ref-id="3035-23" href="/outworld/3035-23/" slug="outworld">Outworld</a>, <a data-ref-id="3005-91" href="/shao-kahn/3005-91/" slug="shao-kahn">Shao Kahn</a>) Although he attended the tournament, it is unknown if he actually participated. After Shang Tsung's defeat in the hands of <a data-ref-id="3005-188" href="/liu-kang/3005-188/" slug="liu-kang">Liu Kang</a>, Raiden receives a challenge from Shao Kahn for a new Outworld tournament. (in which the defeat of Raiden and the Earthrealm warriors results in the weakening of Earthrealm's barriers) Raiden advises Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and the forces of Earthrealm about Shao Kahn's intention. It is not known if he directly participated in the tournament.</p><h3>Merging of the Realms</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1054/544031-bio2.gif" data-ref-id="1300-544031" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1054/544031-bio2.gif" data-ref-id="1300-544031"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1054/544031-bio2.gif"></a><figcaption>Raiden in Deadly Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>After Shao Kahn's initial defeat, he initiates a plan to merge the two realms via ressurection of the Outworld queen <a data-ref-id="3005-407" href="/sindel/3005-407/" slug="sindel">Sindel</a> in Earthrealm. As Shao Kahn invaded Earthrealm and devoured millions of souls, Raiden protected a select few mortals. However, Shao Kahn counters by sending extermination squads to destroy any survivors. Due to the merging of the realms, Raiden could not participate as a god. He instead temporarily reliquinshed his status as a god and sacrificed his immortality. He leads the chosen warriors into battle, and (together with Liu Kang) defeat Shao Kahn once again.</p><h3>The Forces of Light</h3><p>After regaining his status as the god of thunder, Raiden was unaware that the amulet Sub-Zero retrieved from Netherrealm (before the first tournament) was fake. Quan Chi helps Shinnok escape and both escape to <a data-ref-id="3035-614" href="/edenia/3035-614/" slug="edenia">Edenia</a> with the intention of conquering all the realms and the destruction of the Elder Gods. Raiden and the god of wind, <a data-ref-id="3005-381" href="/fujin/3005-381/" slug="fujin">Fujin</a>, organize a group of Earthrealm warriors to combat Shinnok. Being victorious, Raiden is granted the status of Elder God, leaving the responsibility as the protector of Earthrealm to Fujin.</p><h3>Against the Deadly Alliance</h3><p>As an Elder God, Raiden could not interfere with the deadly alliance of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. Disgusted, Raiden relinquishes his status as an Elder God and returns to being the protector of Earthrealm. After reuniting with his comrades in Shang Tsung's old island fortress, he leads them to Outworld to confront the two sorcerors. However, the forces of Earthrealm were slain, and Raiden was defeated. As the two sorcerors turned on eachother, they were confronted by the resurrected Demon King <a data-ref-id="3005-401" href="/onaga/3005-401/" slug="onaga">Onaga</a>. In an effort to defeat Onaga, Raiden allied with the two sorcerors. In desperation, he used his godly energy to create a bomb in hopes of destroying Onaga. Onaga survived and took Shinnok's powerful amulet (used by Quan Chi) for himself.</p><h3>Raiden's Corruption</h3><p>Raiden's essence regathered in Earthrealm, but he became furious at how Earthrealm was treated by its inhabitants (particularly at how <a data-ref-id="3005-406" href="/shujinko/3005-406/" slug="shujinko">Shujinko</a> was deceived into ressurecting Onaga). He vowed no longer to entrust the safety of Earthrealm to mankind. Instead, he chose to enforce the protection of Earthrealm and destroy all those who threaten it. Raiden reanimates the corpse of Liu Kang (who earlier was killed by the deadly alliance) to serve as his <a data-ref-id="3015-79" href="/zombie/3015-79/" slug="zombie">zombie</a> enforcer. During the events of <a data-ref-id="3030-11843" href="/mortal-kombat-armageddon/3030-11843/" slug="mortal-kombat-armageddon">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</a>, Raiden makes a temporary alliance with Shinnok and Shao Kahn (who, in return, would spare Earthrealm).</p><h3>Changing the Past</h3><p>While battling Shao Kahn as the lone remaining warrior at the top of the pyramid from Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Raiden sends a message to his past self just as he is about to lose that "He must win." This message is received by Raiden just prior to the tournament from the original Mortal Kombat. Upon receiving this message, an amulet belonging to Raiden begins to crack. The god of thunder tries to alter the flow of time to prevent the vision that he saw, but his efforts are continually either negated or have unintended affects. In managing to rescue Smoke from the Lin Kuei, for example, he leaves open a door for Sub-Zero to be captured and turned into a cyborg instead. As time marches on through the second tournament and eventually Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm, Raiden becomes more confused and distraught as his efforts appear to be in vain; many of his allies are killed and his amulet continues to crack, until he finally understands what his future self had told him, "He must win" meant "Shao Kahn must win." Due to a loophole in the rules regarding Mortal Kombat, if Shao Kahn were to enter Earthrealm himself, it would be a direct violation of the rules, and he would be subject to punishment by the elder gods.</p><p>Though he realizes this truth, he is unable to convince Liu Kang, who has become convinced that Raiden is mad. He intends to stop Shao Kahn from entering Earthrealm himself. Raiden tries to stop him, but in his efforts, accidentally kills him. Forced to contend with Shao Kahn alone, Raiden receives the support of the elder gods and is able to defeat him. Raiden then rejoins with Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage, intent on rebuilding after the devastation.</p><h2>Endings (non-canon)</h2><h3><a data-ref-id="3030-15743" href="/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/" slug="mortal-kombat"><b>Mortal Kombat</b></a></h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6742/379922-raiden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-379922" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6742/379922-raiden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-379922"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6742/379922-raiden.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mortal Kombat II Arcade Cabinet featuring Raiden</figcaption></figure><p>Raiden becomes bored of <a data-ref-id="3005-92" href="/shang-tsung/3005-92/" slug="shang-tsung">Shang Tsung's</a> sorcery, <a data-ref-id="3005-275" href="/goro/3005-275/" slug="goro">Goro's</a> brute strength, and the weakness of the other competitors.

At the beginning of the episode you see him descend upon Earthrealm and land on the grounds of a mental facility. Since he is dressed in all white the grounds keepers assume he is a patient of the facility and keep him locked in a room. He begs for release to "Fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament or Earthrealm will fall." but of course that only makes people think he's crazier.</p><p>Raiden escapes the facility by befriending a fellow inpatient named Blue. She stabs him in the heart and he disappears and reappears in an alleyway in what appears to be a Chinatown. He grabs a straw hat off a nearby onlooker and walks away.</p><h2><b>Mortal Kombat (2011)</b></h2><h3>Special Attacks</h3><ul><li>Lightning</li><li>Electrocute</li><li>Electric Fly</li><li>Teleport</li><li>Vicinity Blast</li></ul><p><b>Enhanced Attacks</b></p><ul><li>Bolt</li><li>Shocker</li><li>Thunder Fly</li><li>Sparkport</li><li>Vicinity Blast</li></ul><h3><b>X-Ray</b></h3><p>Raiden hits his opponent with a blast of lighting and teleports behind him or her to deliver a devastating blow to their spine which appears to break several vertebrae.
