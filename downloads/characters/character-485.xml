His main purpose is to build different structures to aid his team in battle. The Engineer carries a <a data-ref-id="3055-114" href="/shotgun/3055-114/" slug="shotgun">Shotgun</a>, <a data-ref-id="3055-59" href="/pistol/3055-59/" slug="pistol">a pistol</a>, and a melee weapon; his <a data-ref-id="3055-147" href="/wrench/3055-147/" slug="wrench">wrench</a>. The Engineer is unique in that he can build objects in game, such as; a <a data-ref-id="3055-348" href="/teleporter/3055-348/" slug="teleporter">teleporter</a> entrance and exit, a <a data-ref-id="3055-350" href="/dispenser/3055-350/" slug="dispenser">dispenser</a>, and a <a data-ref-id="3055-68" href="/automated-sentry-gun/3055-68/" slug="automated-sentry-gun">sentry gun</a>. The wrench can be used to speed up the building process of any these weapons, repair them, or destroy sappers left by <a data-ref-id="3005-488" href="/spy/3005-488/" slug="spy">Spies</a>. The wrench also uses "metal" to upgrade the sentry or to repair objects. "Metal" can be gathered from supply points on the map, through the dispenser, or from dropped weapons.</p><p>With eleven scientific PhDs and his talent for playing the acoustic guitar, this gun loving redneck is far more than what meets the eye. In every match he proves himself to be an invaluable asset to the team. That is, when he's not having a hoe-down next to his sentry.</p><ul><li><b>Health</b>: 125</li><li><b>Speed</b>: 100% of normal</li><li><b>Character Type</b>: Defense</li><li>Advantages: Provides powerful frontline or fallback support, sentry is an insurmountable obstacle for most classes alone</li><li><b>Disadvantages</b>: Pyros, Demomen, and Spies can easily destroy your buildings if you're not careful, cannot directly assist in fighting without endangering his setup</li></ul><p>The Engineer is voiced by <a data-ref-id="3040-89620" href="/grant-goodeve/3040-89620/" slug="grant-goodeve">Grant Goodeve</a>.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>This amiable, soft-spoken good ol' boy from tiny Bee Cave, Texas loves barbecue, guns, and higher education.

Whacking structures with the wrench will double their construction speed, repair them, refill their ammo or upgrade them, doing so in that order as needed. It also removes sappers by two hits each. The wrench is also a good weapon to use in close range when you need to take down spies and other enemies eying your little HQ's.</p><p><b>Damage</b></p><ul><li><b>Point Blank</b>: 65 <i>(59 to 72 damage)</i></li><li><b>Mini Crit</b>: <i>88</i></li><li><b>Critical Hit</b>: 195</li></ul><h2>Building Kits</h2><p>The engineer is able to build four different buildings: a sentry gun, a set of teleporters, and a dispenser. Every building has 150 health except level two and three sentries that have 180 and 210, respectively. He u ses a separate resource called metal to deploy, upgrade and repair and rearm his work. He starts with 200, his maximum amount. It can be replenished by any source of ammo. All structures can be upgraded up to two times for all 200 metal per level.</p><p>An ability added in the Engineer Update, all of your buildings can be packed up and re-deployed elsewhere. Simply done by walking up to a finished building of yours and right clicking, this will instantly pack up your building into it's toolbox where you can walk around (at reduced speed) and re-deploy it elsewhere. When re-deployed, a building will construct at a much faster rate, but if it's a level two or three sentry it has to go through each construction animation.</p><h3>Sentry Gun - 130 metal</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409699-sentrylvl1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409699" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409699-sentrylvl1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409699"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3616/409699-sentrylvl1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Level one sentry.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409710-800px_sentry_gun_level_2_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409710" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409710-800px_sentry_gun_level_2_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409710"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3616/409710-800px_sentry_gun_level_2_b.jpg"></a><figcaption>Level two sentry.</figcaption></figure><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409736-800px_sentry_gun_level_3_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409736" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3616/409736-800px_sentry_gun_level_3_b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-409736"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3616/409736-800px_sentry_gun_level_3_b.jpg"></a><figcaption>Level three sentry.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-ref-id="3055-68" href="/automated-sentry-gun/3055-68/" slug="automated-sentry-gun">sentry gun</a> is the engineer's (and possibly the game's) most powerful weapon, after it's fully deployed a sentry will automatically track and fire upon any enemies within it's range with deadly precision. A starting level one sentry is equipped only with one barrel which has a slow rate of fire. A level two sentry has two turrets and has an increased rate of fire. A level three turret adds on a four barreled rocket launcher. Each level adds max health and ammo reserve to the sentry as well.</p><h3>Dispenser - 100 metal</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4053/377237-dispenser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377237" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4053/377237-dispenser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377237"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4053/377237-dispenser.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dispenser</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id="3055-350" href="/dispenser/3055-350/" slug="dispenser">Dispensers</a> are medium size structures that provide metal, ammo, and health for you and your teammates. The dispenser can give a great advantage to your team, if placed in the right location you and your teammates can stay alive much longer. Ideal locations are either right by your sentry, to keep you stocked up on metal and healing any damage you take; or right behind the front lines to minimize your teammates' down time.</p><p>Although while normally when you pick up ammo you will also acquire an equivocal amount of metal, the dispenser deals the two out separately. Ammo will restock at a rapid rate (even faster when upgraded) but the metal must be generated separately. Every 5 seconds it will garner 40, 50, or 60 units (depending on it's level) of metal and store it, every time this happens you will hear a mechanical cranking sound. When built, the dispenser will be holding 25 metal, and can hold up to 400 units. Whenever a friendly engineer is near a dispenser it will use it's stores to replenish any of his spent metal at 40, 50 or 60 units every half second, depending on it's level. Healing starts at about 10 HP restored a second, with ~5 HP/s added each level.</p><h3>Teleporters - 125 metal each</h3><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4053/377274-teleexit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377274" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4053/377274-teleexit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-377274"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4053/377274-teleexit.jpg"></a><figcaption>Teleporter</figcaption></figure><p><a data-ref-id="3055-348" href="/teleporter/3055-348/" slug="teleporter">Telporters</a> are used to carry people from one place to another, you have to build the entrance and exit separately. It's a helpful way to get your players to the front line faster. Every time the teleporter is used, it has a recharge time which is dependent on it's level. The teleporters are really helpful for slow-moving classes like the <a data-ref-id="3005-484" href="/heavy/3005-484/" slug="heavy">Heavy</a> and the <a data-ref-id="3005-480" href="/soldier/3005-480/" slug="soldier">Soldier</a>.</p><p>The teleporter recharge takes 10 seconds to complete at first level, going all the way down to 5 then 3 seconds at 2nd and 3rd level. Both teleporters are effected when you wrench them, this means repairs, upgrading and sapper removal is done simultaneously. If either one is destroyed it will revert the remaining teleporter back down to level one.</p><p><i>Note: If an enemy is standing on your teleporter when someone comes through they will be</i> <i>telefragged</i>. Conversely if an enemy spy uses your teleporter the same thing could happen to you or anyone on your team!</p><p><b>Tips</b>:</p><ul><li>The Engineer is able to self destruct any of his buildings anytime he wants by taking out his big red button. Any time a building is destroyed it will leave behind bits and pieces that can be picked up for ammo/metal.</li><li>If a spy is doing nothing but sapping your sentry you have to kill him first, trying to repair constant sapping will accomplish nothing.</li><li>The Engineer's buildings take damage from all weapons, but the majority of classes cannot put out damage on your sentry as fast as you can repair it, provided you have the metal. A demoman can get around this by launching enough stickies onto the area to take it (and maybe you) down in one blow. If you see them landing either shoot them as fast as possible to get rid of them, or go for the kill and take out the demo while he is concentrating.</li><li>It's not always be wisest to repair your sentry in response to an attack, especially if the sentry is likely to go down. Many enemies need to focus their attacks directly at the sentry to destroy it leaving them wide open to a few 12ga shells to the chest. If your sentry dies while your repairing it you will be left swinging your wrench out in the open, if it's destroyed while you are counter attacking you will often have a weak enemy that is easy to finish off. If successful the metal from his fallen weapon plus the bits from your sentry should easily cover the cost to replace it right away.</li><li>Critical hits do not do any extra damage to buildings.</li><li>When placing your buildings you can rotate them in 90° increments by hitting secondary fire. This can fit sentries closer to corners, dispensers flusher to walls, or change which way your teammates come out of teleporters.</li><li>While placing a sentry you will notice a pair of dotted lines and when in a large enough area a transparent ring around you. The dotted lines indicate the forward field of fire, enemies will be fired upon in that zone almost immediately where enemies approaching outside it will be safe until the sentry turns to face them. The transparent ring indicates the range, make sure your sentry can reach all the entrances to the room it's defending.</li><li>When defending an area with your sentry you will often get a few kills from the first couple of enemies to run into it but they will very quickly learn to stay out of the way. A planned attempt to dislodge your sentry is going to be inevitable, you need solid teammates to disrupt them. Otherwise try dismantling and moving your sentry often, they will see that it's gone and might let down their guard, walking right into your new one.</li></ul><h2>Taunts</h2><h3>Pistol</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1671172-engineertaunt2.png" data-ref-id="1300-1671172" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1671172-engineertaunt2.png" data-ref-id="1300-1671172"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80630/1671172-engineertaunt2.png"></a><figcaption>Taunt position when the pistol is equipped.</figcaption></figure><p>The engineer spins the pistol in his hand while laughing evilly.</p><h3>Shotgun</h3><figure data-align="left" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1671171-engineertaunt1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1671171" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="small"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1671171-engineertaunt1.png" data-ref-id="1300-1671171"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/80630/1671171-engineertaunt1.png"></a><figcaption>Taunt position when the shotgun is equipped.</figcaption></figure><p>The engineer cheers while performing a hoedown.</p><p>"Woooo hoo!"</p><p>"Heeeey ya!"</p><p>"Yippee ki yaa he yay kyaaah kayo!"</p><p>"Hee hee!
