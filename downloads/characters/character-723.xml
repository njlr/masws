Edge's assignment at the start of the game is to guard an excavation site from ancient monsters. The Captain reveals that the Empire has infact been looking for something there for the last 20 years, although they have no idea what the precious artifact could be.<br/>    <br/>    During the games opening sequence the Dig site is invaded by Craymen, an ex soldier of the empire who now leads a group known as the black fleet. Craymen is intent of stealing a recently discovered ancient artifact (which is later revealed to be the android <a data-ref-id="3005-751" href="/azel/3005-751/" slug="azel">  Azel</a>). All of the mercenaries are murdered by Craymen's psychotic henchman Zastava including the Captain and Edge's friend Rhua, Edge is shot and cast deep into the ruins.<br/>    Deep in the ruins Edge is rescued by the Heresy Dragon (a reincarnation of the dragon from the previous Panzer Dragoon games) and chosen as the new rider. Using the dragons power Edge vowes to avenge his fallen comrades and recover Azel from Craymen.<br/>    Edge's quest was initially one of vengeance but soon he became bound to the dragon's goal of destroying the Towers, A goal which he accomplishes at the end of the game at the cost of sacrificing his own life.<br/><br/>    After the events of Panzer Dragoon Saga the drone Azel, who had by this time fallen in love with Edge, desperatley searched for her lost love. While she was unable to find any trace of his physical body she was able to find a record of his genetic code (recorded by the Towers central AI sestren) and by mixing this with her own DNA she was able to create <a data-ref-id="3005-2531" href="/orta/3005-2531/" slug="orta">  Orta</a>, a half human half drone whom she believed had the power to change the world.<br/><br/><h2> Captain's Diary</h2><figure data-align="right" data-embed-type="image" data-img-src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1520/529527-captain.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529527" data-resize-url="" data-resized="" data-size="medium"><a href="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1520/529527-captain.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-529527"><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1520/529527-captain.jpg"></a><figcaption>The captain as he appears in Panzer Dragoon Saga</figcaption></figure> 19th day of 10th month<br/> <br/> Two weeks have past since we came to the excavation site, <br/>accepting the Empire's commission.<br/>They are desperately trying to find something. <br/>The director of this excavation site has been looking for over 20 years already. Crazy. <br/>It appears that, once again, they have failed to find whatever it is they're looking for. <br/>As always, we're left in the dark.<br/> <br/> 25th day of 10th month<br/> <br/> Thanks to that huge wind net, there's no way a monster could get in here. <br/>This job is probably going to be easier than I first thought. This evening, I talked with the director. <br/>Apparently only 'smart' folks can enter the Imperial Academy. <br/>He said enrolling in a normal school should be his first priority. <br/>I'll talk to Edge.<br/> <br/> 8th day of 11th month<br/> <br/> As always, nothing new at the excavation site, all they've dug up is ancient garbage.<br/> I talked to the director again. He says it'll cost a lot of dynes just to enroll Edge in school.<br/> I'm worried that there's only a few good years left in me and I won't be able to earn enough money to pay for Edge's schooling.<br/> <br/> 20th day of 12th month<br/> <br/> Why did I start writing this diary? It's not like me at all. I guess it's because of him.<br/> How many times have I told him that I think of him as my son?<br/> But I've never done anything that a parent would do.<br/> Unlike me, barely literate, Edge is a smart kid. I want him to be enrolled in a school in<br/> the Empire. Being a mercenary in the middle of nowhere is not a job for an<br/> innocent boy. After this job is done, I plan to take him to the Capital.<br/> I want to do more than write in my diary, I should start studying myself.<br/> I don't want him to be ashamed of me when he grows up.<br/> Will Edge ever call me...<br/> father?]]></description><gender>1</gender><id>723</id><image><icon_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_avatar/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></icon_url><medium_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></medium_url><screen_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/screen_medium/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></screen_url><small_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></small_url><super_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></super_url><thumb_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></thumb_url><tiny_url><![CDATA[http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/square_mini/0/1520/178326-edge.jpg]]></tiny_url></image><last_name/><name><![CDATA[Edge]]></name><real_name/><site_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/edge/3005-723/]]></site_detail_url><first_appeared_in_game><api_detail_url><![CDATA[http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-3692/]]></api_detail_url><id>3692</id><name><![CDATA[Panzer
