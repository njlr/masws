However, Lightning eventually becomes trapped in a time paradox after being attacked by waves of unknown darkness. She sees her friends surrounded by enemies and before she could help them, Lightning gets swallowed into an abyss by chaos.</p><p>Lightning is removed from history and everyone believes that she had perished or had turned into crystal along with Fang and Vanille. Her sister, Serah is the only one to believe that Lightning is still alive. In truth, Lightning had fallen through the Historia Crux of which she ended up in <a data-ref-id="3035-1223" href="/valhalla/3035-1223/" slug="valhalla">Valhalla</a>, the realm of death. She stands before Etro’s Shrine and offers herself to the goddess becoming Etro’s guardian.</p><p>As she stands upon a balcony, Lightning has visions of a young man falling through the Historia Crux before being attacked by <a data-ref-id="3005-22324" href="/caius-ballad/3005-22324/" slug="caius-ballad">Caius</a>. He summons a number of monsters to attack her and the two of them battle. Lightning uses her gunblade and her Eidolon, Odin as well as various summoned monster to assault Caius until her summons a barrage of Comets. Lightning manages to avoid the attack and comes face-to-face with Caius.</p><p>The two ends up sword fighting until Caius transforms into Chaos Bahamut and pursues Lightning through Valhalla. Using Odin, Lightning leads Caius into the city and manages to gain the upper hand in the battle, burying Caius under a pile of debris. After the battle, Lightning witnesses Etro’s Gate opening and a young man falling out of it. Lightning recognises the man as <a data-ref-id="3005-19917" href="/noel-kreiss/3005-19917/" slug="noel-kreiss">Noel Kreiss</a> as the man previously seen in her vision.</p><p>Lightning saves Noel from his fall and they defeat Caius yet again when he comes back to pursue them using <a data-ref-id="3005-1744" href="/bahamut/3005-1744/" slug="bahamut">Bahamut</a>. The two land upon the shrine where Lightning explains that she cannot leave Valhalla unprotected. She asks Noel to help save Serah and shows him a time gate as well as giving him a moogle named <a data-ref-id="3005-10590" href="/mog/3005-10590/" slug="mog">Mog</a> to assist him. She instructs Noel to find Serah and bring her to Valhalla before the shrine is crushed by a meteor summoned by Caius.</p><p>Lightning re-appears later on in the game before Noel, Mog and Serah while they are in New Boduhum. Lightning explains that the group are in the year 700 AF, an alternative future that she failed to save. Lightning goes on to explain that after the defeat of Orphan and Fang and Vanille’s sacrifice to save Cocoon, a portal opened up to Valhalla. She explains that <a data-ref-id="3005-22611" href="/etro/3005-22611/" slug="etro">Etro</a> closed the door to stop chaos coming to the word.</p><p>However, time had been altered and as a result Lightning was caught up in the darkness and removed from time. Lightning remained in Valhalla and could see all of time and saw the future of the world. Etro is being destroyed and if she vanishes completely, the world would be in loss which is why Lightning dedicated herself in protecting her. She tells Noel and Serah that Caius plans to kill Etro while she sleeps and unleash chaos onto the mortal world through a doorway.</p><p>Lightning goes on to say that to open the door wide enough, a large amount of people would have to be destroyed at the same time. After Serah says that the world will eventually become like Valhalla, Lightning realizes that Caius’s plan is to create a timeless world. Noel explains that Caius wants to create a timeless world to save Yeul from a cursed fate. Lightning reveals that she has been fighting Caius both in Valhalla as well as the real world and that the future will not change until they stop him.</p><p>Lightning tasks Noel and Serah to stop Caius in the real world while she deals with him within Valhalla. Serah asks Lightning if they will be together again and Lightning replies “One thing at a time” before heading back into the portal. Lightning visits the Vile Peaks and feels responsible for a paradox which caused an Academy team called Blitz Squadron to disappear. Lightning appears before Noel and Serah again before they fight he paradox of Odin, Twilight Odin.</p><p>After the two defeats Twilight Odin in 200 AF, Lightning is released from the burden of Odin’s shadow twin. Lightning them remembers when she fought alongside the men in the Blitz Squadron years ago and is happy that they remember her even through her disappearance. Later on, Mog comes across a image of Lightning and tells Serah that when Lightning was a I’Cie she thought that fighting was the only way forward until she realized that she was not alone.</p><p>Being alone in Valhalla, Lightning holds onto her memories of Serah and her friends and tells Serah that she prays for the day they can be reunited before she disappears. Serah and Noel fight Caius in Valhalla before they are consumed by darkness and set into an abyss. Lightning appears and saves the two and motivates them to stay alive before vanishing again. After defeating Caius, he tells them that he already killed Lightning before the battle began. After the chaos ends and Valhalla spills out and turns <a data-ref-id="3035-1192" href="/pulse/3035-1192/" slug="pulse">Gran Pulse</a> into Valhalla, Lightning is shown sitting on Etro’s throne, crystallized.</p><p>Lightning serves as narrator and as a playable character during the game's prologue. DLC for the game also allows her to be fought in the colosseum as an optional opponent; if the player wins, she will become usable as a Ravager in the same manner as the game's monster allies, but this "playable" incarnation of Lightning is not considered the same as the real Lightning.</p><h2>Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</h2><p>In the upcoming <a data-ref-id="3030-39185" href="/lightning-returns-final-fantasy-xiii/3030-39185/" slug="lightning-returns-final-fantasy-xiii">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a>, Lightning, awoken from her crystal stasis, must embark on one final mission to stop the destruction of the world, which will occur in thirteen days.</p><h2>History and Personality</h2><p>Lightning is a <a href="../../pseudonym/92-2261/" rel="nofollow">pseudonym</a> that she adopted when she was about fourteen years old after her parents died in a car accident.
